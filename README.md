# K-Nearest-Neighbors
This java application was designed to test and explore the efficiency of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It is used to classify a specific point in a dataset by finding the pointâ€™s k nearest neighbors. 
The application	implements advanced sorting algorithms and developed unique methods to ensure accuracy. This university project received a perfect 300/300 score.

In this application, a chosen number of datasets are created. These datasets include a differing amount of points, each containg a random x and y coordinate. Each point in the dataset is classified into two groups based on the values for the x and y coordinates. A random test point is created for each dataset. The application then runs the test point through the dataset using the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm to determine which group the point should be classified to. The application then displays which group the point was classified to and the accuracy of the algorithm on the dataset.

To use this application, first run the RandomInputGenerator.java file, then run the KNN.java file.
